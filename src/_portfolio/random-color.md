A small demo made for the Game Boy Advance, I created this to learn how to make video games on the handheld console. It generates a series of 16-bit random colors (and optionally displays their hex codes), and can save up to 256 different colors. Additionally, it temporarily stores each randomly generated color, allowing you to go back if you've missed it. Coded entirely in C.
