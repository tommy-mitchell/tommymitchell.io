As part of a two-semester course series in game development, I worked with a team of four using Unity to create a puzzple-platformer demo centered around teleportation. My responsibilities included implementing mechanics, designing levels, and creating all art assets. Our game was among the best in the class, and was selected to compete in a competition hosted by [Saljack Enterprises](https://saljackenterprises.com/).
