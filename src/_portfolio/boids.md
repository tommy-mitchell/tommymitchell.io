A [*boid* system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) is an emergent set of rules that "simulates the flocking behavior of birds by steering each individual *boid* according to said simple rules. This demo is an example of the boids algorithm extended to bees in Unity, and is viewable in-browser on [Itch.io](https://github.com/tommy-mitchell/bee-boids).
