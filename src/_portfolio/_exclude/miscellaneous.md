Some other assorted projects of mine, including a collection of various pixel art pieces (hosted on [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/LqnzSCK)), a [repository](https://github.com/tommy-mitchell/COSC4370) of homework from an Interactive Computer Graphics class, and a high school [video game project](https://masterfulmonkey.itch.io/dodge-game) made in Java.
