*Booper* is an in-development JavaScript library based on Josh W. Comeau's [*useBoop*](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/boop/) React effect, using my own fork of the spring library [*wobble*](https://github.com/tommy-mitchell/wobble).


If you're on a computer, you've probably seen some of the effects on this page: the magnifying glass on each portfolio item, the close button on this modal, or the download button for my resume. Play around with the examples below, and tap them if you're on mobile!

<span class="booper">
    <span><i class="fas fa-exclamation boop-scale-1.05"></i></span>
    <span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down boop-y-10"></i></span>
    <span><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right boop-x-10-rotate-45"></i></span>
