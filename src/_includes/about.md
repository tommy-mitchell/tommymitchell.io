Hi, I'm Tommy<span class="im-paul">!</span> I'm a **programmer** that likes making **video games** and that cares about **aesthetics**.

I've been making games and pixel art since I was a kid, messing around with things like *Scratch*, *Roblox*, and *Minecraft*. I always wanted to do so many different things when I grew up, but after I took a computer science class in high school, I knew that I was hooked on coding.

From there, I attented the **University of Houston**, graduating in December of 2020 with a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** and a minor in **Mathematics**. My skills have come a long way â€” and I know enough to know that there's still so much to learn.

Since graduating, I've done **freelance** work as well as **video game development**, working at **Precursor Gaming** in **Unreal Engine 4** to develop a space-simulation game. I've also spent time working on personal projects, participating in **game jams** with **Unity** and building my own demos.

While in college, I interned at **Asset Living** in Houston, TX, helping to migrate the company to Microsoft Sharepoint and developing an application to allow automated invoice uploads. I also took a two-semester long course in **video game development**, working in a team of four using **Unity** to create a 2D puzzle-platformer that was best in class.

In my free time, I'm a hobbyist rock climber and an avid reader.
